数据库学习oracle之过滤和排序.md

#在查询中过滤行


```sql

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,LAST_NAME from EMPLOYEES;


```
使用where来过滤，添加查询条件
```sql

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,LAST_NAME,SALARY 
from EMPLOYEES
WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID > 200

```

```sql

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,LAST_NAME,SALARY 
from EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY > 5000

```
```sql

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,LAST_NAME,SALARY 
from EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID > 90

```

字符和日期只能包含在单引号里面。
```sql
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE  to_char(HIRE_DATE,'yyyy-mm-dd')='1994-06-07';
```

比较运算符使用的是 “=” 而不是“==”


between ...   and ....
```sql

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE  SALARY>=4000 and SALARY<7000;

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 4000 and 7000;



```


where ...  in ....
```sql

SELECT LAST_NAME,DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =90 or DEPARTMENT_ID = 70 OR DEPARTMENT_ID = 80;

SELECT LAST_NAME,DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID in (70,80,90);

```

where ... like ....   模糊查询
```sql


SELECT LAST_NAME,DEPARTMENT_ID,SALARY
  FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE '%a%';



```

% 表示匹配多个
_ 下划线表示匹配一个

怎么转义一个字符，escape后面的字符可以自定义的。

```sql


SELECT LAST_NAME,DEPARTMENT_ID,SALARY
  FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE '%\_%' ESCAPE '\';

```

where ... is  null
```sql

SELECT *
  FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE COMMISSION_PCT is NULL ;

```

where ... is not null

```sql

SELECT *
  FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE COMMISSION_PCT is NOT NULL ;

```






#在查询中进行排序


order by

--从小到大排序(默认)
```sql

SELECT LAST_NAME,SALARY,DEPARTMENT_ID
  FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID=80 ORDER BY SALARY; 

SELECT LAST_NAME,SALARY,DEPARTMENT_ID
  FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID=80 ORDER BY SALARY ASC ; 
```

使用desc 从大到小排序
```sql

SELECT LAST_NAME,SALARY,DEPARTMENT_ID
  FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID=80 ORDER BY SALARY DESC ;

```

```sql

SELECT LAST_NAME,SALARY,DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY SALARY DESC, DEPARTMENT_ID ASC 

```
